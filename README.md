# Arduino-Uno-Tesla-Coil-Winder
Tesla Coil Winder
Still Building this thing
Tested with fishing string .41mm

Software used is  Modified for Nextion enhanced 3.5 inch NX4832K035-011 screen I had
attached firmeware from Mr Innovative, I commented in the code from what I learned (I think)

Gsuite_v1.4_3.rar  Is programe to make coil to gcode, if you want to use 3dprinter software to run the Machine

Shaft just slides into coupling, for easy removal to change cones.

I have tryed every software out there and they have issues. mainly they only work when tuned in to one setting, and they get bragged on real BIG for their video's

Then I found Found a Excellant Program for the  Arduino-Uno-Tesla-Coil-Winder, rduart, doing a Awesome work      https://github.com/rduart/TelsaCoilWinder
I did have to dial it in to work with the 2mm pitch leadscrew setup. and added some background pictures, and enlarged the font for my eye's.
Still so far only testing with .4mm nylon fishing string.

Added Stepper controlled Spool Winder, can also be used a tenstioner, by appling varable control voltage of 0 - 2 Volts on one of the coil windings 2 Volts likly too much.
