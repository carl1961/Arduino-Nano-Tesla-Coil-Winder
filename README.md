Shaft just slides into coupling, for easy removal to change cones.

I have tryed every software out there and they have issues. mainly they only work when tuned in to one setting, and they get bragged on real BIG for their video's

Then I found Found a Excellant Program for the  Arduino-Uno-Tesla-Coil-Winder, rduart, doing a Awesome work      https://github.com/rduart/TelsaCoilWinder
I did have to dial it in to work with the 2mm pitch leadscrew setup. and added some background pictures, and enlarged the font for my eye's.
Still so far only testing with .4mm nylon fishing string.
